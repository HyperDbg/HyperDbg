/**

 * @author Sina Karvandi (sina@hyperdbg.org)
 * @brief This is the implementation for custom spinlock.
 *
 * @details This implementation is derived from Hvpp by Petr Benes
 *      - https://github.com/wbenny/hvpp
 * Based on my benchmarks, this simple implementation beats other (often
 * more complex) spinlock implementations - such as queue spinlocks, ticket
 * spinlocks, MCS locks.  The only difference between this implementation
 * and completely naive spinlock is the "backoff".
 *
 * Also, benefit of this implementation is that we can use it with
 * STL lock guards, e.g.: std::lock_guard.
 *
 * Look here for more information:
